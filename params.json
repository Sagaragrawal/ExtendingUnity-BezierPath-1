  "body": "### Introduction\r\nUnity is well known for its Asset Store and the vast amount of resources available there. Anyone can download tools to simplify the production of their games. Many tools have custom editors for managing the data related to it. Wouldn't it be great to be able to make tools like this ourselves?\r\n\r\nUnity offers an API for extending the editor through scripts in your project. Throughout the parts of this guide, we will learn to master this power and become a Wizard of Unity. We'll take a closer look at interacting with points in the scene using Handles, building custom interfaces for the SceneView and customizing the InspectorView to your liking.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n```cs\r\nusing UnityEngine;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\n\r\npublic class BezierPoint\r\n{\r\n    // TODO: Make handles act according to current ArmMode in the 'set' accessors\r\n    public Vector3 handleBack { get; set; }\r\n    public Vector3 handleFront { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public Vector3 position;\r\n    public List<Vector3> points = new List<Vector3>();\r\n    public List<float> lengths = new List<float>();\r\n    public float length = 0;\r\n    public int iterations;\r\n    public ArmMode armMode;\r\n\r\n    [SerializeField]\r\n    private Vector3 _handleBack, _handleFront;\r\n\r\n    public BezierPoint(Vector3 pos, Vector3 _handleB, Vector3 _handleF, int iter, ArmMode armM)\r\n    {\r\n        position = pos;\r\n        _handleBack = _handleB;\r\n        _handleFront = _handleF;\r\n        iterations = iter;\r\n        armMode = armM;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic enum ArmMode\r\n{\r\n    Mirror,\r\n    MirrorAngle,\r\n    Induvidual\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Qubic BÃ©zier Curve\r\n\r\n### BezierPoint\r\n\r\n### Point Iteration\r\n\r\n### BezierPath\r\n\r\n### Displaying the path",
