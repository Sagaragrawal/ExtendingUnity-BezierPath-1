Many tools have custom editors for managing the data related to it. Wouldn't it be great to be able to make tools like this ourselves?\r\n\r\nUnity offers an API for extending the editor through scripts in your project. Throughout the parts of this guide, we will learn to master this power and become a Wizard of Unity. We'll take a closer look at interacting with points in the scene using Handles, building custom interfaces for the SceneView and customizing the InspectorView to your liking.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\n### Qubic BÃ©zier Curve\r\n\r\n### BezierPoint\r\n\r\n### Point Iteration\r\n\r\n### BezierPath\r\n\r\n### Displaying the path",
